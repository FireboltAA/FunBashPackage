# FunBashPackage
Couple of fun bash commands

**IMPORTANT**: Please note that the installation script modifies the path variable in a bad way that most people would not like. I made this when I was still learning, so for now, it's best to install it manually until the script is updated.

## roll
roll {amount} {type}
e.g. "roll 6 d8"

## flip
Returns heads or tails

## GTN
Starts a guess the number game.
